# bash scripts tested on REDHAT/CENTOS 7.0

The scripts provided here are system administration scripts on RedHat 7.0 or CentOS 7.0.

Most of these scripts here in this repository (https://github.com/westharding/scripts-for-redhat-7.0) are user interactive. 
They can be stopped, continued or skipped the opertions at execution time, 
thus no need for help or documentation. 

You can just run them and you will figure out about that script.
If any question, please contact me to assisst you on using these scripts.
